-- Basic queries
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;   -- Fetch all columns and all records (rows) from table.
SELECT ID, FIRST_NAME FROM STUDENTS; -- Fetch only ID and FIRST_NAME columns from students table.

-- Comparison Operators
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME = 'Mathematics'; -- Fetch all records where subject name is Mathematics.
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME <> 'Mathematics'; -- Fetch all records where subject name is not Mathematics.
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME != 'Mathematics'; -- same as above. Both "<>" and "!=" are NOT EQUAL TO operator in SQL.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY > 10000; -- All records where salary is greater than 10000.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY < 10000; -- All records where salary is less than 10000.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY < 10000 ORDER BY SALARY; -- All records where salary is less than 10000 and the output is sorted in ascending order of salary.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY < 10000 ORDER BY SALARY DESC; -- All records where salary is less than 10000 and the output is sorted in descending order of salary.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY >= 10000; -- All records where salary is greater than or equal to 10000.
SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY <= 10000; -- All records where salary is less than or equal to 10000.


-- Logical Operators

SELECT * FROM STAFF_SALARY WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 2000 AND 5999;
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME IN ('Mathematics', 'Science', 'Arts');
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME NOT IN ('Mathematics', 'Science', 'Arts'); -- All records where subjects is not Mathematics, Science or Arts.
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME LIKE 'Computer%'; -- Fetch records where subject name has Computer as prefixed. % matches all characters.
SELECT * FROM SUBJECTS WHERE SUBJECT_NAME NOT LIKE 'Computer%'; -- Fetch records where subject name does not have Computer as prefixed. % matches all characters.
SELECT * FROM STAFF WHERE AGE > 50 AND GENDER = 'F'; -- Fetch records where staff is female and is over 50 years of age. AND operator fetches result only if the condition mentioned both on left side and right side of AND operator holds true. In OR operator, atleast any one of the conditions needs to hold true to fetch result.
SELECT * FROM STAFF WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%' AND LAST_NAME LIKE 'S%'; -- Fetch record where first name of staff starts with "A" AND last name starts with "S".
SELECT * FROM STAFF WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%' OR LAST_NAME LIKE 'S%'; -- Fetch record where first name of staff starts with "A" OR last name starts with "S". Meaning either the first name or the last name condition needs to match for query to return data.
SELECT * FROM STAFF WHERE (FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%' OR LAST_NAME LIKE 'S%') AND AGE > 50; -- Fetch record where staff is over 50 years of age AND has his first name starting with "A" OR his last name starting with "S".


-- Arithmetic Operators

SELECT (5+2) AS ADDITION;   -- Sum of two numbers. PostgreSQL does not need FROM clause to execute such queries.
SELECT (5-2) AS SUBTRACT;   -- Oracle & MySQL equivalent query would be -->  select (5+2) as Addition FROM DUAL; --> Where dual is a dummy table.
SELECT (5*2) AS MULTIPLY;
SELECT (5/2) AS DIVIDE;   -- Divides 2 numbers and returns whole number.
SELECT (5%2) AS MODULUS;  -- Divides 2 numbers and returns the remainder


SELECT STAFF_TYPE FROM STAFF ; -- Returns lot of duplicate data.
SELECT DISTINCT STAFF_TYPE FROM STAFF ; -- Returns unique values only.
SELECT STAFF_TYPE FROM STAFF LIMIT 5; -- Fetches only the first 5 records from the result.


-- CASE 

SELECT STAFF_ID,SALARY,
CASE WHEN SALARY >= 10000 THEN 'HIGH SALARY'
	 WHEN SALARY < 10000 AND SALARY >= 5000 THEN 'MID'
     WHEN SALARY < 5000 THEN 'LOW'
END AS SAL_RANGE
FROM STAFF_SALARY
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


-- TO_CHAR / TO_DATE

SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE TO_CHAR(DOB,'YYYY') = '2014';
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE DOB = TO_DATE('19-JAN-2014','DD-MON-YYYY');
SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE DOB = TO_DATE('19-01-2014','DD-MM-YYYY');
